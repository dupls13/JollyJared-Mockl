                <p>This website is dedicated to help promote my small businesses and to educate people that individuals with disabilities can succeed with a little bit of help from their family and friends.
                    My start-up businesses include beach supply rental and delivery, coffee delivery, and firewood sales and delivery.
                    My goal is to make all three of these successful enterprises that will give me the opportunity to make some income, but more importantly, to make new friends and become an active participant in my community.  
                    Check out my site and let me know how I can serve you!
                    Sincerely,
                    Jolly Jared</p>
